### Remarks:
The badge healthbar is independant from the regular healthbar and they can both be used in the same game without influencing each other. However, the badge healthbar is still a healthbar. This means, that if the last badge is [destroyed](DestroyBadges.md),
the frame with the ID `GameOver` will be executed, if it exists.

The appearance and position of the healthbar can be modified via themes.
