# FlashBadgeHealth (FBH)
---
### Description
Flash a specified amount of badges of the badge healthbar.

### Parameters

|Name|Type|Description|Required|Default Value|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Badges|Number|The amount of badges to flash.|✓|1|

### Examples:
#### Example #1: Flash 2 badges.
```
1:  FlashBadgeHealth:[2];
```

#### Example #2: Flash 4 badges.
```
1:  FBH:[4];
```

### Remarks:
The badge healthbar is independant from the regular healthbar and they can both be used in the same game without influencing each other. However, the badge healthbar is still a healthbar. This means, that if the last badge is [destroyed](DestroyBadges.md),
the frame with the ID `GameOver` will be executed, if it exists.

The appearance and position of the healthbar can be modified via themes.
