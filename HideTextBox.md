### Remarks:
This instruction breaks a syntax rule: Using a null character is not necessary. `HTB;` and `HideTextBox;` are valid and will be interpreted as `HTB:[true];` and `HideTextBox:[true];` respectively.

[SetCharacter](SetCharacter.md) will execute this instruction as well unless the `WaitForPre` parameter is `false` and there is a [DisplayText](DisplayText.md) instruction following immediately afterwards.
If these conditions are not met, [SetCharacter](SetCharacter.md) will execute this instruction as `HideTextBox:[true];`.

[LoadCharacter](LoadCharacter.md) will execute this instruction as well unless the `WaitForPre` parameter is `false` and there is a [DisplayText](DisplayText.md) instruction following immediately afterwards.
If these conditions are not met, [LoadCharacter](SetCharacter.md) will execute this instruction as `HideTextBox:[false];`.
